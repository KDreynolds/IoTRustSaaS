# IoT Analytics and Monitoring Platform

This platform is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution designed to provide real-time analytics and monitoring for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It caters to both businesses and individuals who utilize IoT devices and require a system to monitor and analyze the data generated by these devices.

## Features

- Real-time data ingestion from IoT devices
- Data storage and management
- Data processing and analytics
- Device health monitoring
- API for data access and integration
- User-friendly dashboard for data visualization and device management

## Architecture

The platform is structured into several components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the service:

- `Ingestion Service`: Handles the real-time data input from IoT devices.
- `Storage Service`: Manages the persistence of device data.
- `Processing Service`: Processes and analyzes the data.
- `Monitoring Service`: Monitors the health and status of connected devices.
- `API Service`: Provides an interface for external access to platform functionalities.
- `Frontend`: A React-based user interface for interacting with the platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the platform, ensure you have Rust and Node.js installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Node.js (LTS version)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the Rust dependencies by running `cargo build`.
4. Install the Node.js dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

### Configuration

Before running the services, you need to set up the configuration files for each service. The configuration files are expected to be in TOML format.

### Running the Services

Each service has its own executable. To start a service, run the corresponding main file:

- Ingestion Service: `cargo run --bin ingestion_main`
- Storage Service: `cargo run --bin storage_main`
- Processing Service: `cargo run --bin processing_main`
- API Service: `cargo run --bin api_main`

The frontend can be started with:

```sh
npm start
```

or if you are using yarn:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Testing

To run the tests for each service, use the following commands:

- `cargo test` for Rust components
- `npm test` or `yarn test` for the frontend
